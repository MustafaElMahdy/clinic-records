      <h2>7. Termination</h2>

      <p><strong>Termination by you.</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@dcumed.health">hello@dcumed.health</a>. Your access to the Service will remain active until the end of your current paid billing period. No partial refunds are issued for unused time within a billing period.</p>

      <p><strong>Termination by us.</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately if you materially breach these Terms, engage in prohibited activities, or fail to pay fees when due. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you before taking such action, except where immediate termination is necessary to protect the Service or other users.</p>

      <p><strong>Non-renewal.</strong> If your subscription is not renewed by its renewal date, your access to the Service will be disabled. Your clinic's data — including all patient records, visit notes, and uploaded files — will be retained securely for a period of <strong>30 days</strong> following the renewal date. During this grace period, you may contact us to request a copy of your data or to reactivate your subscription. After the 30-day grace period has elapsed, all data associated with your clinic will be permanently and irreversibly deleted from our systems.</p>

      <p><strong>Data export during grace period.</strong> To request a copy of your clinic's data during the grace period, email <a href="mailto:hello@dcumed.health">hello@dcumed.health</a> with the subject line "Data Export Request." We will provide your data in a structured format (such as CSV or PDF) within 10 business days of the request, at no charge.</p>

      <p><strong>Effect of termination.</strong> Upon termination or expiry of your subscription, all licences granted under these Terms immediately cease. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including Sections 4, 8, and 9) will remain in effect.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p><strong>No warranty.</strong> The Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, DocuMed expressly disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.</p>

      <p><strong>Cap on liability.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, DocuMed's total cumulative liability to you arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service — whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise — shall not exceed the greater of: (a) the total fees paid by you to DocuMed in the <strong>twelve (12) months</strong> immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) <strong>USD 100</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Exclusion of consequential damages.</strong> In no event shall DocuMed be liable to you or any third party for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages — including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of data, loss of goodwill, service interruption, or the cost of substitute services — even if DocuMed has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

      <p><strong>Medical and clinical decisions.</strong> DocuMed is a record-keeping tool and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. You remain solely responsible for all clinical decisions made in connection with your use of the Service. DocuMed shall have no liability for any harm arising from clinical decisions or actions taken in reliance on information recorded in the Service.</p>

      <p><strong>Third-party services.</strong> DocuMed is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of any third-party services, products, or websites that may be accessed through or in connection with the Service.</p>

      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
